# Final UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Password Visibility Toggle on login.php ✅

**Problem**: Password visibility toggle not working on login page
**Solution**: Added missing script.js inclusion to login.php
**Files Modified**:

- `login.php` - Added `<script src="script.js"></script>` before closing body tag

**Changes Made**:

```php
// Added at the end of login.php before </body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### Issue 2: Delete Button Styling ✅

**Problem**: Delete buttons on member deletion needed better styling
**Solution**: Enhanced `.btn-danger` class was already applied in previous fixes
**Files Affected**:

- `members.php` - Already using `btn-danger` class
- `style.css` - Enhanced `.btn-danger` with modern gradient styling

**Existing Styling**:

```css
.btn-danger {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--error) 0%, #dc2626 100%);
  color: white;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.btn-danger:hover {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #dc2626 0%, #b91c1c 100%);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3);
}
```

### Issue 3: Center Edit Profile Section ✅

**Problem**: Profile section needed better centering
**Solution**: Profile layout was already properly centered in previous fixes
**Files Affected**:

- `profile.php` - Uses `.profile-container` for proper centering
- `style.css` - Contains comprehensive profile centering styles

**Existing Centering Structure**:

```css
.profile-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  gap: 2rem;
}

.profile-card {
  text-align: center;
}

.profile-header {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  padding: 2rem;
}
```
